How can I see a counsellor?

You can find directories of counsellors through their professional organizations. 
 Registered Clinical Counsellors: visit the BC Association of Clinical Counsellors 
 Canadian Certified Counsellors: visit the Canadian Counselling and Psychotherapy Association 
 Canadian Professional Counsellors: visit the Canadian Professional Counsellors Association 
 For more specialized counselling professionals, such as Marriage and Family Therapists, see the Federation of Associations for Counselling Therapists in British Columbia. 
 You can make an appointment on your own. You don’t need a doctor’s referral to see a counsellor. 
 Counsellors are not usually covered by MSP, so you’ll have to pay for the cost of the appointment yourself. Workplace extended health benefits, Employee (Family) Assistance Programs, or private health insurance plans may help cover some costs. Some counsellors may offer a sliding scale based on your income. If you’re facing financial hardship, you can ask when you make the appointment. 
 Learn more about lower-cost options to access counselling or email us with your location and our information and referrals team can see what options there may be in your community. 
 If you see a counsellor through a public mental health centre like a mental health team or outpatient psychiatry program, it will still be covered by MSP. Talk to your care provider if you have questions or want to learn more. 
 Indigenous community members can access some counselling services locally or through the First Nations Health Authority. Contact your local Band or local Friendship Centre, or contact the First Nations Health Authority.
