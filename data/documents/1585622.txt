Where can I find child and youth mental health services?

To find help for a child or youth, you can: 
 Encourage your child to talk to a teacher or school counsellor 
 Talk to your family doctor or pediatrician, or go to a walk-in clinic 
 Contact your local Child & Youth Mental Health office on one of their walk-in days 
 Use Kelty Mental Health’s Help Finder Tool to find specific services and providers 
 Contact the Institute of Families for Child and Youth Mental Health’s Youth-in-Residence or Parent-in-Residence for guidance, information, and support. Youth-in-Residence and Parents-in-Residence are located around the province. If you don’t have one in your community, a Parent- or Youth-in-Residence at the Kelty Mental Health Resource Centre can help you by phone or email 
 Visit www.familysmart.ca for information and resources on child and youth mental health 
 For young people ages 12-24, visit foundrybc.ca to see if there is a Foundry Centre in your area. Foundry offers easy-to-access mental health care, physical health care, social services, and support out of one office.
