Where can older adults find help for mental health concerns?

Mental health concerns are a serious concern at any age, and everyone deserves help and support. If you’re concerned about your mental health, you can: 
 Talk to your family doctor or go to a walk-in clinic 
 Call the Mental Health Support Line at 310-6789 (no area code) for information about services in your area 
 Find your local mental health centre or program at www.gov.bc.ca/mentalhealth (you may need a doctor’s referral to access some programs) 
 Find your local Canadian Mental Health Association branch at www.cmha.bc.ca and ask for information about local services 
 Contact a local senior’s support organization or group and ask for advice. You can search for organizations at www.bc211.ca 
 For general information about senior’s mental health: 
 Find resources from the Canadian Coalition for Seniors' Mental Health at www.ccsmh.ca 
 Find info sheets in the Seniors and Depression Series at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/factsheet/seniors-and-depression-series 
 If you are concerned about a loved one: 
 Be honest about your concerns, like changes you’ve noticed or problems that have come up 
 Give your loved one a chance to talk about their perspectives. They may have a different take on the problem or have different priorities in their health care 
 Be patient—it will probably take more than one conversation 
 Whenever possible, aim for cooperation. Focus on finding an action or solution that everyone can agree on 
 Remember that asking for help is hard for many of us, and it can be even harder as people’s roles and abilities change. If your loved one isn’t willing to talk about their experiences with you right away, offer alternatives like the BC Mental Health Support Line (310-6789—no area code needed), the Seniors Distress Line (604-872-1234) or a local seniors support organization (search for organizations at www.bc211.ca) 
 Seek support to manage your expectations and your own well-being. It can be very stressful to see a loved one experience health problems. But adults who can care for themselves and aren’t at risk of harm are free to make their own choices—and that includes refusing help
