If I become involved in treatment what do I need to know?

Beginning treatment is a big step for individuals and families and can be very overwhelming. It is important to continue involvement in the treatment process as much as possible. Some questions you will need to have answered include:

Are there other diagnoses where these symptoms are common?
Do you normally include a physical or neurological examination?
Are there any additional tests or exams that you would recommend at this point?
Would you advise an independent opinion from another psychiatrist at this point?
What program of treatment is the most helpful with this diagnosis?
Will this program involve services by other specialists? If so, who will be responsible for coordinating these services?
What do you see as the family's role in this program of treatment?
How much access will the family have to the individuals who are providing the treatment?
What medications are generally used with this diagnosis? What is the biological effect of this medication, and what do you expect it to accomplish? What are the risks associated with the medication? How soon will we be able to tell if the medication is effective, and how will we know?
How much experience do you have in treating individuals with this illness?
