How can I find a doctor, psychiatrist, psychologist, or counsellor?

To find a family doctor (general physician), visit the College of Physicians and Surgeons of BC to use their Find a Physician tool. You can also see a family doctor at a local walk-in clinic, though it’s helpful to find a regular doctor if you have ongoing care needs. You can also find a psychiatrist through the College of Physicians and Surgeons of BC. Be aware that you almost always need a doctor’s referral to see a psychiatrist. 
 You can find a registered psychologist through the BC Psychological Association and the College of Psychologists of BC. 
 To find a clinical counsellor, visit the BC Association of Clinical Counsellors.
