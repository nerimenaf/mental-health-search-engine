How can I pay for mental health care?

Mental health services provided through the government-run (‘public’) system, like services you receive through your local mental health centre or team, an outpatient psychiatry at a hospital are most often completely covered by MSP. As long as you are eligible for MSP, you won’t have to pay to see someone. 
 For mental health services that aren’t covered by MSP, such as psychotherapy or counselling with a private practitioner, you will have to cover the costs yourself. It’s no secret that these services can be expensive, but you may be able to offset the costs through: 
 Extended health coverage from your own or an immediate family member’s workplace benefits 
 Employee (Family) Assistance Program from your own or an immediate family member’s workplace benefits 
 For students, school or campus mental health services 
 For Indigenous community members, services offered through your Band, Friendship Centre, Indigenous support organization, or the First Nations Health Authority 
 Cultural or faith communities may offer some mental health services 
 You may be able to claim some larger costs related to treatment of a mental health condition on your income tax return under health expenses 
 Some providers offer lower-cost services or a sliding scale, usually based on your income. Email us with your location and our information and referrals team can help you look for options in your area. 
 If costs are a barrier to health care, talk to your doctor to see if there are any services in the public health system (covered by MSP) that may be a good fit for you. You can also called the Mental Health Support Line at 310-6789 (no area code) for more information on local mental health services.
