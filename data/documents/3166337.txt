How can I see a psychologist?

To find a Registered Psychologist, visit the BC Psychological Association. You can make an appointment on your own. You don’t need a doctor’s referral to see a psychologist. 
 Registered Psychologists are not usually covered by MSP, so you’ll have to pay for the cost of the appointment yourself. Workplace extended health benefits or Employee (Family) Assistance Programs may cover some costs. Some psychologists offer a sliding scale based on your income. If you’re facing financial hardship, you can ask when you make the appointment. 
 If you want to learn more about lower-cost options to access counselling (though not usually by Registered Psychologists), email us with your location and our information and referrals team can see what options there may be in your community. 
 If you see a Registered Psychologist through a public mental health centre like a mental health team or outpatient psychiatry program, it will still be covered by MSP. Talk to your care provider if you have questions or want to learn more.
