What is a prodrome?

Prodrome is a medical term for early signs or symptoms of an illness or health problem that appear before the major signs or symptoms start. 
 Psychosis, a group of symptoms found in disorders like schizophrenia, is one illness with a specific prodrome. With psychosis, prodrome signs and symptoms start before full symptoms like hallucinations and delusions appear. 
 Common symptoms in the prodrome of psychosis include: 
 These symptoms are found in many other mental illnesses, so it isn’t always clear at the time if this is a prodrome of psychosis or schizophrenia or something else. It’s best to seek help whenever you are concerned about your mental health or a loved one’s mental health. Psychosis and schizophrenia are much easier to manage and treat when treatment starts early.
