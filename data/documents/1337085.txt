I have thoughts of suicide, or someone I care about is talking about suicide. What should I do?

If you need to talk to someone or you aren’t sure how to help someone you care about, call 1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433) at any time. Or type your concern using live chat (like texting online) at www.crisiscentrechat.ca between noon and 1am. They can help you, and they can suggest good local resources. If you’re at risk of harm or think someone else is in danger and you need help right now, call 911. 
 It’s scary to have thoughts of suicide or hear that someone you can care about has thoughts of suicide. Thoughts of suicide don’t mean that someone will end their life, but it’s a sign that they need extra help or support. If you have thoughts of suicide, it’s important to talk with your doctor or mental health service provider. If you’re supporting someone else, encourage them to seek help. 
 Coping With Suicidal Thoughts is a good resource to help you understand and manage difficult feelings.
