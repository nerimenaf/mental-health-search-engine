I’m an adult and I think I might have ADHD. What can I do next?

While we think of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder as an illness that affects children, it can last into adulthood—and some people aren’t diagnosed until much later in life. 
 ADHD is diagnosed like any other mental illness, so your family doctor is a good place to start. Your family doctor may be able to assess your mental health and start treatment, if needed, or they may refer you to more specialized mental health services. 
 There are a few organizations that can help you find good resources and find some support: 
 The Canadian Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Resource Alliance (CADDRA) is an organization that supports health professionals who research ADHD, treat and support people diagnosed with ADHD, and trains professionals. In the ‘Public Info’ section of their website, you’ll find more information on adult ADHD and the assessment process. You’ll also find extensive resources and recommended publications. 
 The Centre for ADHD Awareness, Canada provides education and advocacy for Canadians who experience ADHD. They have a section on their website for adults, including information on symptoms and assessments, treatments, ADHD in the workplace, resources, and a reading list. 
 CHADD Vancouver offers a monthly support group for adults in the Vancouver area.
