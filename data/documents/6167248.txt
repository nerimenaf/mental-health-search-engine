When is substance use a problem? Where can I go for help?

Each person has a different relationship with substances like alcohol and other drugs, and people use substances for different reasons. What’s beneficial for some may cause problems for others, or for the same person in different situations. 
 To learn more about substance use, check out Understanding Substance Use: A health promotion perspective. For more on supporting someone else, a useful resource is Helping People who Use Substances: A health promotion perspective. 
 To help you think about your relationship with substance, You and Substance Use: Stuff to think about...and ways to make changes is a great workbook. Another series, Making Healthier Choices about Substance Use: Tips for cutting back or quitting, has a lot of useful tips and resources if you want to change the way you use alcohol, marijuana, medications, methamphetamine, and tobacco.
