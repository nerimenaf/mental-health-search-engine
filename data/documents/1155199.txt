If I become involved in treatment, what do I need to know?

Do you normally include a physical or neurological examination?
Are there any additional tests or exams that you would recommend at this point?

How much access will the family have to the individuals who are providing the treatment?
What medications are generally used with this diagnosis?
How much experience do you have in treating individuals with this illness?
What can I do to help you in the treatment?
